# Understanding the Learning Models

This document explains the three core learning models used in ToolShed to capture, reflect on, and share professional development insights.

## Overview

ToolShed is built around three complementary reflection frameworks that transform individual training experiences into organizational knowledge. Each model serves a distinct purpose in the learning journey: capturing immediate insights (Postcards), structuring behavioral change (3-2-1), and facilitating peer-to-peer knowledge transfer (Takeovers).

## Learning Postcards

The Learning Postcard model provides a structured format for capturing actionable insights from training sessions, conferences, or professional development activities. Inspired by the familiar postcard metaphor, this format encourages practitioners to distill their learning into four distinct sections that target different cognitive levels.

The **Elevator Pitch** section asks users to summarize their training in 30 seconds or less. This constraint forces learners to identify the core message and practice articulating it concisely—a skill that proves valuable when colleagues ask "what was that training about?" The **Lightbulb Moment** captures the key insight or realization that shifted the learner's thinking. By identifying this pivotal moment, practitioners develop metacognitive awareness of their own learning process.

The **Programme Impact** section bridges theory and practice by asking how this learning will affect work with young people. This application-focused prompt ensures training translates into practical improvements rather than remaining abstract knowledge. Finally, the **Golden Nugget** identifies what colleagues would most benefit from knowing—transforming individual learning into shareable organizational knowledge.

This four-section structure loosely follows Bloom's Taxonomy, moving from knowledge recall (summary) through comprehension (insight) to application (impact) and synthesis (sharing). The visual, interactive postcard format—complete with a flipping animation—makes engaging with reflections more memorable and enjoyable.

## The 3-2-1 Reflection Model

The 3-2-1 model implements a classic reflective thinking framework widely used in adult education and corporate training. Its structured format—three learnings, two changes, one question—guides practitioners through a comprehensive reflection process that emphasizes behavioral change.

The **Three Learnings** section captures the most significant new knowledge gained from a training experience. By limiting responses to three items, the model forces prioritization and prevents the common pitfall of trying to remember everything while retaining nothing. These learnings form the foundation for subsequent reflection.

The **Two Changes** section represents the model's most distinctive feature: a commitment to behavioral change. Rather than simply cataloguing what was learned, practitioners must identify specific actions they will take differently as a result. This forward-looking focus transforms passive learning into active implementation planning. Research in adult learning consistently shows that intention-setting significantly increases the likelihood of applying new knowledge.

The **One Question** section encourages intellectual humility and continued learning. By articulating what remains unclear or what new curiosities have emerged, practitioners position themselves for deeper exploration. This question often sparks follow-up learning or productive discussions with colleagues who may have answers.

The 3-2-1 model's power lies in its simplicity. The memorable structure (3-2-1) makes it easy to apply consistently, while the descending numbers naturally guide attention from broad learning toward focused action.

## Ten-Minute Takeovers

The Takeover model addresses a common organizational challenge: how to scale individual learning across teams. When one person attends training, the entire team potentially benefits—but only if that learning is effectively shared. Takeovers provide a structured framework for scheduling and preparing peer-to-peer knowledge transfer sessions.

Each Takeover represents a commitment to present key learnings to colleagues in a dedicated 10-minute slot during a team meeting. The model asks practitioners to select a meeting date and identify their top learnings to share. This preparation process reinforces learning through the well-documented "teaching effect"—preparing to explain something to others deepens one's own understanding.

The 10-minute constraint is intentional. It's long enough to share meaningful content but short enough to fit into existing team meetings without requiring separate calendar time. This pragmatic approach increases the likelihood that knowledge sharing actually happens rather than being perpetually postponed.

By transforming individual training into scheduled team presentations, Takeovers create accountability for knowledge transfer. The public commitment to present on a specific date motivates thorough preparation and ensures valuable insights don't remain siloed with a single team member.

## Themes and Knowledge Organization

All three learning models support a flexible tagging system through themes. Users can assign themes (such as "Leadership," "Trauma-Informed Practice," or "Communication") to any reflection, enabling discovery and connection across the organization.

Themes serve multiple purposes. For individual practitioners, they provide a way to track personal development across different competency areas. For teams, themes enable targeted searches when facing specific challenges—finding all organizational knowledge related to "Difficult Conversations," for example. For the organization as a whole, theme patterns reveal where professional development investment is concentrated and where gaps may exist.

The theme system is intentionally bottom-up rather than top-down. Users can create new themes as needed, allowing the organizational taxonomy to evolve naturally based on actual learning activities. This approach balances structure with flexibility, avoiding the rigidity of predetermined categories while still enabling meaningful organization.

## Visibility and Sharing

Each reflection includes a visibility setting that determines its sharing scope. Content can be shared at the organization level (visible to all authenticated users) or restricted to the author's team. This flexibility allows practitioners to share broadly when appropriate while keeping sensitive or context-specific reflections within their immediate team.

The default toward openness encourages knowledge sharing across organizational boundaries. When someone in one team attends training relevant to other teams' work, organization-wide visibility ensures those insights reach everyone who might benefit. Team-level visibility remains available for reflections that require more context to interpret meaningfully or that relate to team-specific initiatives.

## The Learning Journey

These three models work together to create a complete learning cycle. When practitioners attend training, they might begin with a Learning Postcard to capture immediate insights while the experience is fresh. Later, they might create a 3-2-1 reflection to structure their thinking about behavioral changes. Finally, scheduling a Takeover commits them to sharing with colleagues, reinforcing their own learning while building organizational capacity.

This progression from individual reflection through structured planning to peer teaching mirrors evidence-based approaches to adult learning. Each step deepens understanding and increases the likelihood that training investment translates into improved practice.

The ultimate goal is transforming ToolShed into a living repository of organizational learning—a searchable, themeable collection of insights that grows more valuable over time as practitioners contribute their reflections and discoveries.
